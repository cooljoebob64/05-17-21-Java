// Challenge 4
// Create a single object named "slideshow" that represents the data and functionality of a picture slideshow. There should be NO VARIABLES OUTSIDE THE OBJECT. The object should have properties for:

// An array called photoList that contains the names of the photos as strings

// An integer currentPhotoIndex that represents which photo in the photoList is currently displayed

// A nextPhoto() function that moves currentPhotoIndex to the next index ifthere is one, and:

// logs the current photo name.

// Otherwise, log "End of slideshow";

// A prevPhoto() function that does the same thing, but backwards.

// A function getCurrentPhoto() that returns the current photo from the list.
